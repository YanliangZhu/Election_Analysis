## Summary
This code script can provide the election commission with summary information regarding the election result. The commission can use the script to conduct an audit of the result and report the number and percentage information of the election. The result and summary of the election can be accessed on the .txt document in the analysis file. By changing .csv data within the data file, the commission can use the script for auditing other election results and declare the winner by popular vote.

Two example usages of the script:
Importing the data into the data/Resources file and run the script, and obtain the result.
Modify the .py coding to change output formate (i.e., the result) on the .txt document in the analysis file.
